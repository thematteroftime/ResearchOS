  "simulation_results_description": "In both ARA and SRA, successful protocols follow paths in the (s,λ) plane that avoid discontinuous phase transitions, leading to convergence to the correct ground state. When such paths exist, both methods succeed, but SRA achieves lower error faster due to direct thermal relaxation. Crucially, there exists a narrow regime where SRA succeeds while ARA fails, demonstrating superior robustness of the classical method in mean-field models.",
